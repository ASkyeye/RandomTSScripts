## LAPSv2Decrypt BOF

### Compiling

This example uses the BOF VS Template. Not sure on the licensing of sharing the full template, so to be sure:

1. Create a new project using the BOF template
2. Overwrite `bof.cpp` with `lapsv2decrypt.cpp`
3. Build
4. Copy output to the `bin` directory and load `lapsv2decrypt.cna` into CobaltStrike
5. Have phun!

### Running

If you don't want to build the BOFs (you really should), you can just run the prebuilt BOFs in the `bin` directory:

Or.. you can load the prebuilt BOFs from the `bin` directory.
